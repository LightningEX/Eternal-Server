# Eternal Server
Details on my Minecraft server series, Eternal! Includes descriptions on how it works, the systems, and possibly world downloads!

# What is the Eternal series?
Eternal is a series of servers created to provide a cool and original RPG-style experience, optionally playable with mods!

World downloads will be provided (eventually). But in the meantime, you can join the Realm! Join the Discord server for the code, Bedrock edition players only: (Discord code soon)

# Can I be a part of the creation or maintenance of your servers?
The short answer? Maybe. I mostly create these servers by myself or with my friend. Command, coding, modding, or building knowledge is required! Experienced people only!

# What platforms can play?
All platforms are welcome! Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, or PC! I should mention, PC players will be more frequently monitored to ensure the safety and security of the server. Hacking or exploiting will not be tolerated.
